Real-time Chat Application: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO

Some ideas to improve the application:

 - Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
 - Add support for nicknames.
 - Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as they press enter.
 - Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
 - Show who’s online.
 - Add private messaging.
